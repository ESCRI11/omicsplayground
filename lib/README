This folder (.../lib) should contain only internal data that is needed
by the app. Traditionally R packages would put it as R/sysdata.rda but
because we have many data objects we are putting it in a separate
folder for now.

The folder 'lib-raw' contains any original data and scripts that were
used to create the data in this folder. See also the scripts in the
folder .../tools/build. Note the similarity to 'data' and 'data-raw'
folders in R packages.

Eventually, this folder should only contains processed data as *.rda
or *.rds objects, as is recommended by R packaging.
